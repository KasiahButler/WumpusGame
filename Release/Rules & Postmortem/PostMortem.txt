Wumpus Assessment Postmortem:

SCOPE:
	The goal while working on this assessment was to create a game based off of the Wumpus rule set that provides a clean and user friendly
experience and makes use of all of the basic Wumpus rules as well as to create a String Class based on the outline provided. I was able to create the
Wumpus game without any real major issues other than the formatting of my code so that it runs in the correct order, the String Class however was
a far more difficulat endeavor and is where I ran into most of my issues. These issues were mostly derived from my weakness in reading another persons 
premade skeleton code which is a skill I really needed to work on and has improved by working through the String Class, though
I did require quite a bit of outside help from fellow Classmates and Esme or Terry in completing the String Class, after I was finished 
I feel far more comfortable in my abilities to create my own at a later date. I'm relatively proud of how my Wumpus Game came out, 
the Classes created are fully functioning and allowed for a much more readable set of code than my previous attempts at games of this type as well as 
making it far easier to work with. The game is functional though missing pitfalls which i could add relatively easy if I had more time thanks 
to the implementation of a universal "Enemy" Class but overall the effect isn't entirely detrimental to the game.
